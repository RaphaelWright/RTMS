# RTMS
Ralph's Tenant Management System - This web app will just check on tenants, demand rent, track time of stay, deliver eviction notices, enable landlords to deliver announcements

Model - This contains code for database operations stored in classes
View - this will contain all the code about presenting the user, will be named as app.py
controller - TBD

the difference between landlord and tenant will make sense at sign up
